## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

| Issue                  | Solution                                                              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **API key not found**  | Verify `.env` file exists in root directory with correct GROQ_API_KEY |
| **Resume not loading** | Check file permissions and ensure `resume.txt` is in the project root |
| **Model errors**       | Try alternative `LLM_MODEL` in `main.py` or check Groq's status page  |
| **400/401 Errors**     | Validate your API key and ensure it hasn't expired                    |
| **500 Server Errors**  | Check application logs for detailed error messages                    |
| **Slow Responses**     | Reduce chunk size in `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` configuration   |
